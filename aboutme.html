    <h3>Why I took Programming</h3>
    <p>Following the current trends, the future dominant industries will be agriculture and technology. I chose the technology sector because it can be incorporated into any business sector. Technology can be incorporated with agriculture and an example
        is digital farming. Technology can also be incorporated with mining through robotics and software used for processing minerals. Hence, it is the main reason why I chose to do programming.</p>
